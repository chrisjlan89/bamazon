# Bamazon App

This app allows users to run a customer app or manager app from the command line, the customer app will display all products for sale formatted to a table. The manager app allows them to view all products for sale, view low inventory, add inventory to existing items and as well as add new items.

The two apps together are a good showcase of the CRUD functions we can do with databases.



## Setup
I included an sql file to make testing on your own machine easier, just run the file and instant schema to link out to just update the database login credentials.
